  Use to derive the API contract for a feature — an OpenAPI 3.1 document at
  docs/features/{slug}/contracts/openapi.yaml plus a drift/sync report (and an events doc when
  the feature has async flows). Triggers on "api for {slug}", "openapi for {slug}",
  "API contract for {slug}", "lock the interface for {slug}", "events for {slug}",
  "/sdd-api {slug}", "контракт API для {slug}", "OpenAPI для {slug}", "опиши ендпоінти".
  The contract is never hand-written: it is a derived function of data-model.md (typed fields +
  constraints), the sad.md §6 sequence diagrams (error branches, async actors), and spec.md
  acceptance criteria. Runs an inline drift check (does the contract match the model and the
  sequences?) and a reconcile mode. Hard-refuse if data-model.md is missing → run `data-model {slug}` first.

# Skill: api

Projects the upstream artifacts into one HTTP contract. For each acceptance criterion it reads `data-model.md` for the typed shape, the sad.md §6 sequences for the error branches and async actors, and emits `docs/features/<slug>/contracts/openapi.yaml` (OpenAPI 3.1) + an `api-sync-report.md` that proves the contract still matches its sources. If the feature has async flows, it also scaffolds `contracts/events.md`. The contract is **derived, never typed by hand** — generation that diverges from the model or the sequences is the bug this skill exists to catch.

This skill keeps only its own machinery. Question phrasing is **shared** → [`../_shared/ask-style.md`](../_shared/ask-style.md). Depth (events doc only when async; one resource vs full surface) follows the **size matrix** → [`../_shared/size-matrix.md`](../_shared/size-matrix.md). The drift-resolution dialog reuses the shared 4-state actions — keep it short, point the machinery to `_shared`.

## Owner

Backend Lead (drives the interface). The PM confirms each endpoint maps to a real user story; a frontend / consumer engineer is the first reader — the contract is locked before they start integration.

## Inputs

- `<slug>` — same feature slug used by every earlier stage.
- **Gate (hard-refuse if missing):** `docs/features/<slug>/data-model.md`. It is the source of typed fields and constraints; without it the contract would be invented field-by-field. If absent → STOP and point: «run `data-model <slug>` first — the contract is derived from its entities».
- (Expected) `docs/features/<slug>/sad.md` §6 — the Mermaid `sequenceDiagram` blocks. Their `alt`/`else` branches become the error `responses`; an async participant (`<message-bus>` / `<external-system>`) on a mutating flow marks its endpoint `Idempotency-Key`-required and seeds `events.md`. Absent → note the gap (error branches derived from `spec.md` §5 only — likely misses authorization branches) and still generate.
- (Expected) `docs/features/<slug>/spec.md` — §4 user stories give the endpoint list; §5 acceptance criteria give the shape of each happy + error outcome. The spec deliberately holds **no** HTTP/status/error-code/SQL detail — that mapping is this skill's job.
- (Optional) `docs/features/<slug>/.size` — depth hint. Absent → default to M (full surface). `docs/features/<slug>/adr/*.md` — override defaults (versioning, error format, auth scheme) when an ADR mandates it; `docs/features/<slug>/CONTEXT.md` — glossary terms become schema names verbatim. Existing `contracts/openapi.yaml` → diff and update in place, never overwrite whole-cloth.

## Protocol

1. **Gate + read.** `test -f docs/features/<slug>/data-model.md` → fail = refuse with the pointer above. Read it (entities, fields, types, constraints), `sad.md` §6 (flows + `alt`-branches + async actors), `spec.md` §4/§5. Surface a one-line "found / missing" note for sad.md and spec.md — never refuse on their absence, only narrow the derivation and record the gap in the report.
2. **Copy the template.** [`./templates/openapi.yaml`](./templates/openapi.yaml) → `docs/features/<slug>/contracts/openapi.yaml`. If async flows exist, also [`./templates/events.md`](./templates/events.md) → `contracts/events.md`. Fill `info.description` from `spec.md` §1 (why this API exists).
3. **Derive endpoints + schemas.** One endpoint (or more) per §4 user story. Every request/response field traces to a `data-model.md` entity column — copy its constraints across (`maxLength`/`pattern`/`enum` from the model's bounded types). **Never invent a field with no origin in any input** — ask the user where it comes from. `$ref` every shared schema; no inline duplication. Lists paginate by cursor (`?after=&before=&limit=`), wrapped in `{items, has_next, has_prev, next_cursor}`.
4. **Derive error responses from the sequences.** Each endpoint covered by a §6 flow: turn every `alt … else … end` branch into a `responses` entry. The error body is the unified envelope **`{code, message, details?}`**; `code` follows the **neutral** convention `module.error_name` (snake_case, e.g. `lesson.not_owned`, `lesson.invalid_state`) — a naming rule, not a language artifact. Map status by class (4xx client / 5xx server). This closes the spec's usual blind spot — §5 lists the happy path + a couple of errors; the sequences enumerate the authorization and concurrent-state branches the spec omits.
5. **Async + idempotency.** A mutating endpoint whose §6 flow shows a retry note or an async actor is marked `Idempotency-Key`-required (state the TTL). For each async message, fill an `events.md` entry: event name `module.action.vN`, payload schema, producer, consumers, retry / dead-letter behaviour.
6. **Examples + placeholder data.** Every operation carries a request example + a success example + an error example, using placeholder values only (`<...>@example.test`, `+380 00 000 00 00`, `Test User`) — never real PII.
7. **Inline DRIFT CHECK (bidirectional) + write the report.** Compare the generated contract against the read artifacts and write `docs/features/<slug>/contracts/api-sync-report.md` — see [`./references/drift-check.md`](./references/drift-check.md). It has a field-origins table (one row per `operation.field`: `path | origin | confidence`) and a checklist. The check runs **both directions**:
   - **forward** (contract derived correctly): endpoint↔model, error-code↔repo, validation↔constraint, OpenAPI↔sequence.
   - **back-feed (coverage cross-check)**: every `spec.md` §5 AC maps to ≥1 operation/response; every operation maps to a §4 user story + ≥1 AC; every `sad.md` §6 `alt`-branch has a response, and any error/authorization response the contract needs but no §6 flow shows is a **sequence gap**. A gap here is not an api bug — it's a hole upstream: surface it and offer **Fix-the-source-first**, which re-opens `specify` (add the missing AC) or `sequences` (draw the missing branch) before the contract is finalized.
   A **core** finding failing (or ≥3 flags total) pauses the run — resolve each via the shared 4-state actions ([`../_shared/ask-style.md`](../_shared/ask-style.md)): Accept-as-is / Fix-the-contract / Save-as-OQ / Fix-the-source-first. Never silently edit the sources — surface the mismatch and let the human pick the right artifact (the contract, the spec's AC, or the sequence).
8. **Lint + write + commit.** Suggest `spectral lint contracts/openapi.yaml` (add it to the project's check target if not yet wired). On a clean check, the files are written; propose commit `api: <slug> contract`. Next: `tasks <slug>`.

### Reconcile mode

`/sdd-api <slug> --reconcile`. Re-derives after an upstream artifact changed (typically `data-model.md` arrived or was tightened after a thinner first pass). It re-reads inputs, tightens loose types where the model now has a constraint, refreshes the field-origins confidence column, and — the load-bearing part — surfaces any field that **had** an inferred origin but **now disagrees** with the model. That disagreement is real drift, not stale incompleteness. `info.version` is never bumped silently; the user does that with a CHANGELOG line.

## Definition of Done

- `docs/features/<slug>/contracts/openapi.yaml` written: OpenAPI 3.1, `BearerAuth` global with public endpoints declaring explicit `security: []`, every error response the `{code, message, details?}` envelope, every operation with examples, all shared types via `$ref`.
- `api-sync-report.md` written alongside: field-origins table + the 4-point drift checklist, every core finding ✓ or explicitly resolved with the user.
- Every endpoint maps to a §4 user story; every field traces to a `data-model.md` column; every error `code` exists in the repo's error definitions (checked in the form the repo uses).
- `contracts/events.md` present iff the feature has async flows; each event has a payload schema, producer, consumers, retry / DLQ note.

## Anti-patterns

- **Contract written by hand**, then the model/sequences bent to fit it. The arrow is one-way: model + sequences + spec → contract.
- **Skipping the drift check** because "it was just generated, of course it matches". Generation can match the spec-as-read while diverging from the model or the sequences — different files, different authors. A clean 4/4 ✓ is cheap; a silent ✗ in prod is not.
- **Error responses from the spec only.** §5 lists happy + a couple of errors; the §6 sequences hold the authorization and concurrent-state branches. Skipping them leaves blind spots.
- **Inventing a field** with no origin in any input, or **silently dropping** one that left `data-model.md` (keep it with a `# stale` note and surface it — the human decides).
- **Stack-specific schema or error names.** Schemas use the domain language from `data-model.md`; error codes are the neutral `module.error_name` convention — not a Go/TS/Python idiom and not tied to any driver's error type.
- **Free-text errors** (`{"error": "failed"}`), `?v=2` query versioning, `nullable: true` (3.0 style — use `type: [string, null]`), offset pagination, or real PII in examples.
